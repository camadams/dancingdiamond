        I am going to start to relive my journey on my little boat when Margie
        and I spent 4 years sailing. It all started in about 1984 when I bought
        a bare hull and built a yacht on Kraanshof farm, current day site 5 or
        Masiphumelele. Since then the beautiful wetlands have been turned into a
        cesspool.

        colony. Most welcoming in 1988. We were entertained and escorted around
        the island for the next 10 days. Never ate on board. Always put up by
        the locals. Amazing diving, littered with wrecks and shot huge fish. No
        scuba allowed, protecting wrecks from plunder. My compressor and air

        half of that. You can go up on the roof and check out the storms or go
        spearfishing in the doldrums. This was before GPS, satnav was around but
        scarce.. You spent most of the day navigating. With a sextant you take

        time and your dead reckoning position and a pile of tables, you get a
        position line. You can be anywhere on that line ! You continuously
        checking gear, at night you tuned into noises of the ocean, sails and
        rigging. No mistakes are allowed, we won't go there.the 2 of us are very

        3 big sailing cats, the waterskiing course was in the lagoon surrounded
        by one of the top golf courses in the world. There were 8 to 10 flights
        a day to and from the island, mainly from the states. Americans came
        here with big budgets and they had to spend it. Everything was laid on,
        free open bar. I managed the dock and skippered the one trimaran. We

        everyday. I was getting to 60 feet and working there. Every day was a
        different fish. Dived mostly with the locals, they dived crayfish. We

        west coasts. This is why they are so possessive over this place. With
        Noriega interfering, they brought in 27 000 marines. helicopter gunships

        little fetch on the water so you get smooth waves. No crowds, maybe a
        few of the other yachts you with. When there is swell it's all day,
        crystal clear warm water, no wetsuit. All waves are found in the passes
        #Mopelia one of our favourite surf spots. Spent a month here. About 4
        other yachts here we raft together, home brew and home grown from the
        island. 1 restaurant and bar. Locals are surf rats, that's all you can
        do and dive and fish. Eventually had to leave, kissed the reef and got 5
        stitches under the chin, knew I was going to get into the water before
        stitches out. 6 to 8 foot perfection every wave the same, barrels after

        polynesia, was Mopelia, an atoll 100 miles away. We were the only yacht
        here. There were 3 families all living about 2 km apart. Marcello, wife
        and 2 kids, they were coconut copra farmers. The pearl divers / farmers
        in the middle and Simon and Andrea in the south. Completely isolated,
        visited once every 6 months by the French navy brought vital suppliers
        and collected copra. We spent our time with these guys. They taught us
        so much on how you survive on atol. Catching seabirds, collecting eggs,
        crayfish, fishing, coconut crabs. Favourite as poison cru or raw fish.
        Best is with a blue parrot fish, soak fish qubes in lemon juice half
        hour, fish will turn white, marinate in coconut milk half an hour.
        Absolutely delicious. After 3 weeks we had to leave the atoll as there
        was starting jealousy and infighting between the families on how our
        time must be split up between them. Next stop Cook islands.

        northern part of cook island 380 miles away. We needed dry goods as we
        shared all with the families on mopelia. Looking back at my diary I see
        we had 3.5 L of drinking water on board. No water on atolls, only rain
        water. Beautiful SE trades to cook islands. Half a day away, the wind
        turns into the N, very unusual. Heavy rain filled all tanks and
        containers with fresh water. I made the whole deck a rain catcher,
        dammed off all outlets on gunnels. This was the start of a mother of all
        storms. A stationary low .the wind changed quickly back to the S. Blown
        off course at the mercy of the ocean, winds at 70 knots. Surfing down
        huge waves touching 18 knots the little yacht vibrates. At night its
        pitch dark the noise is frightening as the waves wash over the whole
        boat and overtake you in the troughs. Only light is the small red
        compass light and you can see the compass turns 90 degrees in a second,
        the sails and rigging go crazy as the wind vane battles to get us back
        on course. For a full 3 days we never or we couldn't open the hatch.
        Only a storm job, the size of a small windsurfer sail. We arrived in
        tonga 17.5 days, 1530 miles. Rhumb line 1280 miles. Tonga was great
        about 1.5 months here. No surf or we didn't look for surf. A lot of

        There was always huge celebrations when you met up with old buddies and
